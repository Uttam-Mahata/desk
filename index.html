    <p>Education is a never ending process. It makes an individual intellectually enlightened, vocationally self sufficient, socially efficient, morally strong, culturally polished and spiritually developed.It is always our earnest endeavour to provide our students with sufficient field and facilities, thoughts and activities, environment and opportunities, inspiration and guidance for a steady all round development.This Vidyalaya delights in seeing its students blossoming into enlightened citizens fully alive to their responsibilities towards parents, society and motherland.</p>
    
    <p>The Year 2019 marked a milestone in the history of this Vidyalaya. In 2019, SUBHADIP MAJI secured the 10th Position in the Madhyamik Pariksha (Secondary Examination). We are grateful to parents for their active co-operation and goodwill to realize the goal. All valuable constructive suggestions are given due consideration. With the continuous support and guidance from the Managing Committee, dedication of our teachers and cooperation of the parents, we are working hard to achieve ahigh standard. We will make our every effort to ensure that our students leave this Vidyalaya with :
    </p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>A set of moral values- honesty, integrity and good judgement</li>
      <li>
        An enquiring mind and a desire for knowledge
      </li>
      <li>
        Strong self-esteem and high personal expectation
      </li>
      <li>
        Idependence and confidence
      </li>
      <li>
        Tolerance and respect for others
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      May our efforts to accomplish this task be fruitful.
